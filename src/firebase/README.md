# Firebase Backend

This directory will contain all the Firebase backend code, including Cloud Functions, security rules, and other configurations.

## Cloud Functions (`functions.ts`)

This file contains backend functions that run in a managed environment. They can be triggered by various Firebase and Google Cloud features, such as Firestore writes, HTTP requests, and more.

To deploy these functions, you will need the Firebase CLI.
